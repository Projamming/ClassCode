# In class, Thursday, September 20
# Demonstrating chords and randomness!

# This chooses a new 'pseudo-random' sequence of values:
use_random_seed 825

# Use these lists in the loop if you want to try notes:
c_major = [:C3, :E3, :G3, :C4, :E4]
c_minor = [:C3, :Eb3, :G3, :C4, :Eb4]

# Here is a list of chords that we will choose from at random:
c_chords = [chord(:C3, :major),
            chord(:F3, :major),
            chord(:G3, :major),
            chord(:A3, :minor)]

use_synth :piano

8.times do
  # The 'choose' function picks a random element from the list c_chords:
  play choose(c_chords)
  sleep 0.5
end
