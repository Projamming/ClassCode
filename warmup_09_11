# Warmup for Tuesday, September 11

# Supply the line of code that would play the sample drum_bass_soft
# every time the clock tick points at a 2 inside the ring beats.

# Note: we messed with this code pretty heavily after we discussed
# the correct answer!

loop do
  tick
  rest = 0
  apple = (ring rest, 1, 2, 2, rest, 1, 2, 2)
  sample :drum_cymbal_soft if apple.look == 1
  if apple.look == 2
    sample :drum_cowbell, amp: 0.2
    sample :drum_bass_hard
  end
  sleep 0.25
