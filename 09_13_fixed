# Written in class on Thursday, September 13.

# We took the code for the Marinera rhythm and compressed it into a couple
# of rings. To simplify the rings, we also defined two variables:

tom =  :drum_tom_hi_hard
bass = :drum_bass_hard

# We define a rhythm section here, and call it in a loop later:
define :rhythm do
  
  # We are looping 7 times because there are seven drum beats:
  7.times do
    
    # This creates a clock and ticks it one tick:
    tick :drums_clock
    
    drums = (ring tom, bass, tom, bass, tom, bass, tom)
    drums_sleep = (ring 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
    drums_amps = (ring 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
    
    # We are using the drums_clock as our clock for this :rhythm function:
    sample drums.look(:drums_clock), amp: drums_amps.look(:drums_clock)
    sleep drums_sleep.look(:drums_clock)
  end
  
end

# This is the loop that plays when we start the program:
loop do
  
  # Here we are using a special clock for just this loop, so that when
  # we tick this clock, the drums_clock in the rhythm function isn't changed:
  bpm_ring = (ring 60, 80, 100, 120)
  use_bpm bpm_ring.tick(:bpm_clock)
  
  # Now that we've set a bpm, we play the rhythm:
  rhythm
  
end
