# Written in class on Tuesday, September 11.
# We took the code for the Marinera rhythm (see below), which was
# written in sample/sleep format, and compressed it into a couple
# of rings. To simplify the rings, we also defined two variables:

tom =  :drum_tom_hi_hard
bass = :drum_bass_hard

define :rhythm do
  
  tick
  
  drums = (ring tom, bass, tom, bass, tom, bass, tom)
  drums_sleep = (ring 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
  drums_amps = (ring 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
  
  sample drums.look, amp: drums_amps.look
  sleep drums_sleep.look
  
  # This is the original code, which we compressed into the rings above:
  
  ##| sample :drum_tom_hi_hard, amp: 2
  ##| sleep 0.5
  ##| sample :drum_bass_hard
  ##| sleep 0.25
  ##| sample :drum_tom_hi_hard
  ##| sleep 0.25
  ##| sample :drum_bass_hard
  ##| sleep 0.5
  ##| sample :drum_tom_hi_hard, amp: 2
  ##| sleep 0.5
  ##| sample :drum_bass_hard
  ##| sleep 0.5
  ##| sample :drum_tom_hi_hard
  ##| sleep 0.5
