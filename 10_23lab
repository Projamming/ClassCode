# Q1. Modify the function 'greet' so that it asks where the user is from and greets them:
# >
# Hello, John from New Hampshire!
#
# Q2. Write a function 'password' that asks the user for the first name of one of their parents, 
# and then their age. Then your program should add the two strings and output the result as a password, 
# as in:
# >
# Your password is Becky22.
#
# Q3. Simulate the flip of a coin. Your output should look like:
# >
# The computer flipped tails.
#
# Q4. Write a program that allows the user to guess whether the computer will flip heads or tails, and
# then report if the guess was successful or not, as in:
# >
# Choose heads or tails:  tails
# The computer flipped heads.
# You guessed correctly!
