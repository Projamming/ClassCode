For in class, Thursday, October 25

Q1. Write a program that asks the user to choose two numbers. The program should then choose a random number
between them, and print 'Quack!' that many times.

Q2. Check the output of each of these three commands:
> puts "a" < "b"
> puts "c" < "b"
> ("a" ... "z").to_a.sample
If you understand the output, continue (otherwise ask for help).
Write a program that chooses a random letter of the alphabet and
then asks the user to guess letters until they are correct. The
program should respond to incorrect guesses helpfully.

Q3. Type this into the REPL and see if you understand what is
being done. If so, continue; otherwise, ask for help.
> s = "david"
> t = s.chars.shuffle.join
Write a game that asks the user to type in a word, then use a loop to scroll that info off the top of the
screen. Scramble the word and show it to the user. Allow them to guess the unscrambled word. Of course, this
is best done with a neighbor.  :)

I will post Project 6 soon!
