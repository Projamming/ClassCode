# Written in class on Tuesday, September 11

# We took the code for the Calypso rhythm (see below), which was
# written in sample/sleep format, and compressed it into a couple
# of rings. To simplify the rings, we also defined two variables:

##| kick = sample :drum_heavy_kick  # We can't write "sample" in the definition
##| tom = sample :drum_tom_hi_soft

# Use this instead:
kick = :drum_heavy_kick
tom = :drum_tom_hi_soft


use_bpm 200

live_loop :calypso do
  
  tick
  
  drums = (ring kick, tom, kick, tom, kick, tom, tom, kick, tom)
  drums_sleep = (ring 1.5, 0.5, 1, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 1)
  
  ## Note: You can't use 'play' to call a sample ##
  ## you can't just call the ring without using 'sample' to call the
  ## kick and tom samples.
  ##| drums.look
  
  # Use this instead:
  sample drums.look
  sleep drums_sleep.look
  
  end
